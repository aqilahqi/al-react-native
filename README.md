# ALEPH LABS

`Aqilah Fatin - React Native`

Hello future manager üëãüèª

Thank you for giving me this oppurtinity! I hope my assessment will give you more insight on my level of capability and competency.

# Get started

Run these commands as per usual

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

# Tasks

Here are the list of tasks to do in this assessment. I will include the time required for me to complete it.

1. Navigation: Implement navigation with two screens:
   - **Landing page**: Display a title and brief description of the app. `1 min`
   - **Photos page**: Fetch and display a list of photos from the API endpoint "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos". Each photo should be presented with its title and image. ~~`10 mins`~~ `2 hour`
2. Data Fetching: Use React Query to fetch data from the specified API and handle potential errors and loading states. ~~`10 mins`~~ `1 hour`
3. Each image should be clickable, navigating the user to the detail page for that image. `30 mins`
4. TypeScript: Utilize TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

# Recap

- Time spent more on styling
- Setting up the project also took some time because I'm not sure to use React Navigation or the Expo Router
- Understanding which element to use was a challenge. I now learn that for a longer list I need to use FlatList. When calling the API and trying to map the list keeps breaking the app
- Making reusable components as needed. Ran into an issue with an Image element wasn't showing. But the component works on another page.
- I used Axios instead of React Query because I just realized the instructions
- Ultimately, my weakness is my lack of understanding in React Native and it's libraries/tools
